Sending e-mails with Django is pretty straightforward. First, you need to have a local SMTP server or define
the configuration of an external SMTP server in the settings.py file of your project.

Run the command python manage.py shell to open the Python shell and send an e-mail like this:
>>> from django.core.mail import send_mail
>>> send_mail('Django mail', 'This e-mail was sent with Django.',
'your_account@gmail.com', ['your_account@gmail.com'], fail_ silently=False)

send_mail() takes the subject, message, sender, and list of recipients as required arguments.
By setting the optional argument fail_silently=False, we are telling it to raise an exception if
the e-mail couldn't be sent correctly. If the output you see is 1, then your e-mail was successfully sent.
If you are sending e-mails by Gmail with the preceding configuration, you might have to enable access for
less secured apps at https://www.google.com/settings/security/lesssecureapps.
